Split the islanders into three groups of four islanders each. We'll identify the islanders like this: **AAAA BBBB CCCC**.

Weigh **AAAA** against **BBBB**. There are three possible outcomes:

1. **AAAA** weighs the same as **BBBB**.

    We have now learned that all of **A** and all of **B** are the "normal" weight. So the differently weight person is one of **C**.

    Weigh three of the **C** against three people we know to be normal weight. So **CCC** against **AAA**. Once again there are three possibilities:

  1. **CCC** is the same weight as **AAA**. This means that the last person from **C** that you have not weighed is the odd one out. For your third measurement, weigh
    the last **C** against anyone else to determine if he is heavier or lighter.
  1. **CCC** is heavier than **AAA**. This means the odd weight person is one of the three **C** that you just weighed and also that person is heavier than everyone
    else. Weigh two of those **C** against each other; if they are the same, then it is the third **C** that is heavier than everyone else. If they are different, then the
    heavier one is the person that is heavier than everyone else.
  1. **CCC** is lighter than **AAA**. This is the same situation as (1.2) above, only you are looking for the lighter person.

2. **AAAA** is heavier than **BBBB**

    We have now learned that *either* one of the **A** is a heavy person *or* one of the **B** is a light person. This means that all of the **C** people are normal weight.

    Weigh three **A** and one **B** against the other **A** and three **C**, so the scale looks like **AAAB** vs **ACCC**. There are three possible outcomes.

  1. **AAAB** weighs the same as **ACCC**. This means that all of **A** and the **B** included in this measurement are all normal weight, so one of the three remaining **B** is
  an oddly weighted person. And since **BBBB** was already lighter than **AAAA**, we know that **B** is a lighter person. Weigh two of the remaining **B** against each other; if one is
  lighter, then he is the lighter person. If they are the same, then the remaining unweighed **B** is the lighter person.
  1. **AAAB** is heavier than **ACCC**.
  This means that one of the three **AAA** on the heavier side is a heavier person (since we already eliminated the possibility of **B** being heavier or **A** being lighter). Weigh
  two of those **A** against each other. If one is heavier then he is the heavier person, if not then the remainining unweighed **A** is the heavier person.
  1. **AAAB** is lighter than **ACCC**.
  This means that either the **B** in this measurement is a light person, or the single **A** is a heavy person. Weigh the **A** against anyone else (except that **B**). If he is
  heavier then the **A** is the heavy person, and if they are the same then the **B** is the light person.

3. **AAAA** is lighter than **BBBB**
  This case is the same as case (2) above, only with **A** and **B** reversed.
